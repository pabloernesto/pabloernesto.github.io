Randall is great and objectively hilarious. But. "Shift" and "left" do **not** rhyme. They're *suppossed* to. And this *bothered* me (hypothetically I might have tried to sing this). So I kind of... rewrote most of the thing? Without really meaning to? Yay?

```
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David pressed and it typed a word
But you don't use a chorded keyboard, do you?
It goes like this, F4, F6
While on your left, you hold Alt Shift
And on its own it types out Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your key was strong but you didn't salt
Your system fell under assault
In the end reusing passwords overthrew you
She checked your hash against a leak
Took all your stuff and left you a brick
And from your scripts she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

She had a different motherboard
The script blew up when she pressed the chord
She should have writen her code all anew
Despite her working all her wiles
She could not bring back her config files
It's a messy and very broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
```
